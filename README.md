# trainee-api 

In order to complete your interview, you must create the following web-app.

The application is a user management app, you will connect to an API to retrieve all the users. Your application should do the following :

- Display all the current users
- Able to delete a user
- Edit an user
- Create an user

You are free to use any frameworks.

You will connect to the API at this address https://mockapi.io/clone/6053764f45e4b30017291bf5

The design of the page should be simple and user friendly.

e.g. of a route to get all users :
GET https://6053764f45e4b30017291bf4.mockapi.io/users 

Be carefull, every post and put are mocked by mokapi.io... so your data won't be persisted!!!!
